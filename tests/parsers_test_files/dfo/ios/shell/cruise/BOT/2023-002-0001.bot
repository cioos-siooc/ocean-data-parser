*COMMENTS
    Sample_Number    2: SIL: Chauvenet outlier in duplicate study

    Analysis methods:
    -----------------------
    Salinity samples were collected in 200 mL type II glass bottles with disposable nylon
    inserts and screw caps supplied by Ocean Scientific International Limited. They were
    analyzed in a temperature-controlled lab on a Guildline 8400B Salinometer
    standardized with IAPSO standard seawater within 23-25 days after collection.
    For details, see document QF2023-002SAL*.xlsx.

    Nutrient samples were collected in plastic tubes and quick frozen in aluminum
    blocks stored in a -20C freezer.
    All samples were returned to the Institute of Ocean Sciences and they were
    analyzed using an Astoria-Pacific Analyzer following methods described in
    IOS Nutrient Methods (1996) Barwell-Clarke, J. and F. Whitney.
    For details see document QF2023-002_NUTS*.xlsx.

    Chlorophyll samples were filtered onto 25mm GF/F filters after collection,
    and immediately frozen and stored in a -80C freezer. All samples were returned
    to the Institute of Ocean Sciences and analyzed 1-2 weeks after the cruise
    on a Turner Trilogy7200-000.
    Fluorescence readings taken before and after sample acidification were used
    tp calculate chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations.
    NOTE: Flags and comments apply to chlorophyll values only. No flags or comments
    are assigned for Phaeo-Pigment values
    For further details on methodology, see document QF 2023-002_CHL_*.xlsx

        CTD Data Processing Notes:
        ----------------------
        Oxygen:Dissolved, Conductivity and Fluorescence:URU:Wetlabs data are nominal and
        unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.

        CTD salinity values were within +/-0.005 for 3 of the 4 bottle samples available from
        near the bottom of casts. No recalibration was applied.

        Extracted chlorophylls samples were available from the surface. The comparison of
        fluorescence values with chlorophyll followed the usual pattern of fairly close
        agreement for 7 cases when CHL was ~1ug/L and fluorescence being ~50% of CHL for
        the 1 case with CHL ~5ug/L.

        Oxygen:Dissolved:SBE values cannot be confirmed as there was no calibration sampling
        for dissolved oxygen. Surface saturation values were low, between 74% and 90%. Most
        of the casts were very well mixed in the top 5 to 20m which likely explains the low
        values. Errors due to calibration drift or slow response for this type of sensor
        generally involve values being low by only a few %.

        For details on the processing see document: 2023-002_Processing_Report.doc.
