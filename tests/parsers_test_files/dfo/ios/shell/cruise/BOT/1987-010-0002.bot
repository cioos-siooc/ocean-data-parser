   Collection methods:
   -------------------
     Sea Water Temperature:
     - Reversing thermometers mounted on bottles.
     Salinity:
     - Collected in bottles.
     Dissolved Oxygen:
     - Collected in bottles.

   Analyzes methods:
   -------------------------
     Temperatures at depth were measured by deep-sea reversing thermometers of
     German (Richter and Wiese) and/or Japanese (Yoshimo Keiki Co.) manufacture.
     Two protected thermometers were used on all bottles, and one unprotected
     thermometer was used on each bottle at depths of 250 m or greater. The
     accuracy of protected reversing thermometers is believed to be +-0.02C.

     Salinity determinations were made at sea with a Guildline model 8400 lab
     salinometer.

     Depth determinations were made using the "depth difference" method
     described in the U.S.N. Hydrographic Office Publication No. 607 (1955).
     Depth estimates have an approximate accuracy of +-5 m for depths less than
     1000 m, and +-0.5% of depth for depths greater than 1000 m.

     The dissolved oxygen analyses were done in the shipboard laboratory by a
     modified Winkler method (Carpenter, 1965).
